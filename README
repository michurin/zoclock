Known problems
--------------

Some X11 window managers can temporary lost an application window
in some rare conditions. Known workaround is to remove flag
`Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint` from `BinClockWidget` constructor
in `src/zocwidget.cpp`.

If you are faced with this phenomenon, please let me know.


Enjoy!
